# Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Assignment

## 📌 Overview
This assignment focuses on understanding and implementing **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**, which is used to compute the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph (with non-negative edge weights).

## 📂 Contents Included
- Problem statement  
- Background and history of Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- Key idea and intuition  
- Pseudo code  
- Step-by-step example  
- Comparison with the Bellman–Ford Algorithm  
- Python implementation  
- Output of the shortest path distances  

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Graph representation using adjacency lists  
- Greedy selection of the minimum-distance vertex  
- Use of a priority queue (min-heap)  
- Time complexity analysis  
- Advantages and limitations of the algorithm  

## ▶️ How to Run the Code
1. Run the Python script.  
2. Enter:
   - Number of nodes  
   - Number of edges  
   - Each edge in the format: `u v w`  
   - Source node  
3. The program outputs the shortest distance from the source to every other node.

## 📝 Conclusion
Through this assignment, I gained a clear understanding of how Dijkstra’s Algorithm works internally and how it is applied in practical systems like GPS routing, network optimization, and pathfinding in applications and games.
